Hi, I’m Solomon Key — a data architect and analytics expert with 17+ years of experience helping organizations unlock the value of their data. I bring a thoughtful, systems-oriented approach to every problem, balancing technical rigor with a sharp eye for usability and clarity.
With a background in computer science and deep roots in SQL, business intelligence, and data visualization, I’ve led the development of scalable pipelines, intuitive dashboards, and lightweight documentation frameworks that make data more accessible to everyone — not just analysts.
Outside of work, I’m a father, a builder of things both digital and physical, and a lifelong learner who’s just as curious about gardening and human behavior as I am about metadata standards and machine learning. I believe that clarity, adaptability, and compassion are as important in technical work as they are in life.
Whether I’m designing a data product, exploring a new technology, or mentoring a junior analyst, I bring a grounded, collaborative mindset to everything I do.
